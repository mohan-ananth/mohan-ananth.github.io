Stability Analysis in two-phase cartesian coordinates
------
Stability analysis tool developed for a 2D liquid planar sheet injected into gas. Perturbation equations are obtained by applying symmetric (varicose) and asymmetric (sinuous) perturbations over the mean flow. The perturbation equations are solved using Chebyshev spectral method to determine whether the applied pertubation is stable or unstable.

Stability Analysis in two-phase cylindrical coordinates
------

Large-scale modes observed in liquid sheet breakup
------
The breakup of liquid sheets is caused by large wavelength sinuous modes which are activated at high gas shear layer thickness. The underlying physics of these sinuous modes are explained using Spatial linear stability analysis and high-fidelity Volume of Fluid simulations.

Large-scale modes observed in liquid sheet breakup
======
The breakup of liquid sheets is caused by large wavelength sinuous modes which are activated at high gas shear layer thickness. The underlying physics of these sinuous modes are explained using Spatial linear stability analysis and high-fidelity Volume of Fluid simulations.

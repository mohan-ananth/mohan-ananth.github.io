Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

My primary research focus is on understanding the fundamentals of liquid jet atomization, the modes of disturbances leading to jet breakup, and consequently, the droplet sizes created under various atomization conditions. I have developed tools to solve hydrodynamic instabilities to determine the most unstable modes responsible for atomization in a multi-phase flow environment.  I have also worked on the development of models to solve the multi-component evaporation of urea-water solution (UWS) sprays in engine exhaust to reduce $NO_x$, preventing their release into the atmosphere. Additionally, the simulations involved thermolysis and hydrolysis of urea vapors to form ammonia ($NH_3$) which reacts with $NO_x$ to convert them into $N_2$ and $H_2O$ which can be safely released into the atmosphere. Additionally, I have expertise in numerical methods such as finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods. My research has also helped me develop skills in some data analysis techniques like Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWT) to understand the modes from the computational data of jet atomization.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics group at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research work broadly involves numerical simulations of multiphase flow simulations, involving heat transfer, phase change and chemical reactions. In addition, I have also worked on data analysis methods to analyze the data obtained from numerical simulations. A brief overview of my research is given below:
* <span style="color:blue">Stability analysis tools for multi-phase flows: </span> Development of tools to solve hydrodynamic instabilities in
single-phase and two-phase fluid flows in Cartesian and Cylindrical coordinates using Spectral methods. These tools will aid in understanding liquid atomization in sprays, assisting in predicting the disturbances that would cause the breakup of liquid sheets and jets in spray applications.
* <span style="color:blue">Understanding the primary modes responsible for high-speed liquid sheet breakup:</span> Using stability analysis and high-fidelity Volume of Fluid (VoF) multiphase flow simulations in OpenFOAM, the physics of the large-wavelength modes causing the breakup of high-speed liquid jets is explained.
* <span style="color:blue">Simulation of Urea Water Solution (UWS) sprays in engine exhaust:</span> The UWS spray is simulated using Lagrangian Eulerian simulation. The simulation involves multicomponent evaporation of UWS droplets, thermolysis, and hydrolysis reactions involving the decomposition of urea into ammonia. The ammonia reacts with nitrogen oxides from the engine exhaust and reduces them to nitrogen and water which can be safely released into the atmosphere.
* <span style="color:blue">Data-driven techniques to analyze the modes in jet atomization:</span> Analysis of the spray characteristics in 3D
cylindrical jets using two techniques; a machine learning technique called Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and
Continuous Wavelet transforms (CWT).
* <span style="color:blue">Improvements in curvature and surface tension predictions in OpenFOAM solver interFoam:</span> Distance-based
function implemented in the multiphase flow solver, to predict the surface tension force better and avoid the issue of spurious currents.
